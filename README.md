## PID & PPID

A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call `getpid` (`man 2 getpid`):

```text
julien@ubuntu:~/c/shell$ cat pid.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**
 * main - PID
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
    pid_t my_pid;

    my_pid = getpid();
    printf("%u\n", my_pid);
    return (0);
}
julien@ubuntu:~/c/shell$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic pid.c -o mypid && ./mypid
3237
julien@ubuntu:~/c/shell$ ./mypid 
3238
julien@ubuntu:~/c/shell$ ./mypid 
3239
julien@ubuntu:~/c/shell$
```
Note in the example above, that every time you run the program, a new process is created, and its ID is different.

Each process has a parent: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the getppid system call (man 2 getppid), from within the child process.
